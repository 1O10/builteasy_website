Quite often, a single character marks the separation between columns.  To do this, you use the split function.  sep : str or unicode, optional.  What it does is split or breakup a string and add the data to a string array using a defined separator.  If this is negative (the default), the count will be determined from the length of the data.

This is the opposite of concatenation which merges or combines strings into one.  bpo-27945: Fixed various segfaults with dict when input collections are mutated during Keras is a powerful easy-to-use Python library for developing and evaluating deep learning models.  Raises: ValueError.  Python provides a very straightforward and easy function to do that. The fastest way is to use the numpy.  Grammar and Execution I wonder if there is a direct way to import the contents of a csv file into a record array, much in the way that R&#39;s read.  By using NumPy, you can speed up your workflow, and interface with other packages in the Python ecosystem, like What is a CSV File?

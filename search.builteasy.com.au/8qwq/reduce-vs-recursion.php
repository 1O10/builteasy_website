This is a page from my book, Learning Functional Programming in Scala.  It is a top-down parsing algorithm because it builds the parse tree In this tutorial, you will learn to create a recursive function (a function that calls itself) in R programming.  Given an array with nested arrays:More generally, whether a procedure is recursive or not, the calls it makes can be classified as subproblems or reductions If the last thing a procedure does is to call another procedure, that&#39;s known as a reduction--the work being done by the caller is complete, because it &quot;reduces to&quot; the work being done by the callee.

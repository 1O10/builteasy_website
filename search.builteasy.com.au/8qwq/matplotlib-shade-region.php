Note that the postscript format does not support alpha (this is a postscript limitation, not a matplotlib limitation), so when using alpha save your figures in PNG, PDF or SVG.  # WARNING: alpha doesn&#39;t work in postscript output.  The method also adds errors to the matplotlib polar plot as a shaded region to help understand the variability in the data.  For example, let&#39;s use axvspan to highlight the x-region between 8 and 14: import matplotlib.  What fills does is it will fill between the variable and a number you can choose. pyplot as plt import numpy as np import urllib import datetime as dt import matplotlib.

Use the fill function to make shaded regions of any color tint. fill_between(date, 0, closep). 6, hatch=&#39;/&#39; ), patches.  +. The differences is that axvspan (and axhspan ) will fill up the entire y (or x) extent of the plot regardless of how you zoom. 6, hatch=&#39;\\&#39;, fill=False ), ]: ax3.

Note # this is different than calling # fill_between(x[where], y1[where],y2[where] # because of edge effects over multiple contiguous regions.  So at this point, our code would be: import matplotlib.  pylab combines pyplot with numpy into a single namespace.  from pylab import * x = arange(10) y = x # Plot junk and then a filled region plot(x, y) # Make a blue box that is somewhat see-through # and has a red border.

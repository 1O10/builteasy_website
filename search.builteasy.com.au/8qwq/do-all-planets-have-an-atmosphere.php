Of these, the planets Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune have significant atmospheres.  Why do the other planets, like Venus (shown above) have a different atmosphere than Earth? Credit: ESA &quot;Don&#39;t let anyone tell you that you cannot do it.  Atmospheric ozone protects us from ultraviolet radiation.  The inner four planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars) lost their original atmospheres.  An atmosphere is more likely to be retained if the gravity is high and the atmosphere&#39;s temperature is low.  The planets that orbit the sun are (in order from the sun): Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune You might see planets twinkling if you spot them low in the sky.  This gas giant has a thick atmosphere, 39 known moons, and a dark, barely-visible ring.  Astronomy And these range from incredibly thin and tenuous (such as Mercury&#39;s “exosphere”) to the incredibly dense and powerful – which is the case for all of the gas giants.  Several moons and other bodies also have atmospheres, as do comets and the Sun.  CO2 and other gases trap heat and keep the surface warm enough for life to thrive.  Oxygen has allowed life to evolve. All planets likely begin with some form of atmosphere.  But then, over time gas molecules will leave the planet if they can attain escape vJan 7, 2016 Why do the other planets, like Venus (shown above) have a different atmosphere than Earth? Credit: ESA.

In addition to Earth, many of the other astronomical objects in the Solar System have atmospheres.

The gases include Hydrogen, Helium and Oxygen.  There is evidence that extrasolar planets can have an atmosphere.  Also, if you are closer to the Sun, the atmosphere is hotter and the molecules are moving faster and so can reach escape velocity.  Earth&#39;s atmosphere is made up mostly of oxygen and nitrogen, and protects us from the Sun&#39;s harmful rays.  These include all the gas giants, as well as Mars, Venus, and Pluto.  On the Earth, it is this envelope that allows organisms to live.  When you heat up the molecules in an atmosphere, the molecules move faster and some of them can escape (this is how we lose hydrogen).  That’s because, in the direction of any horizon, you’re looking through more atmosphere than when In the sixteenth century the Italian philosopher Giordano Bruno, an early supporter of the Copernican theory that Earth and other planets orbit the Sun (heliocentrism Descriptions and meanings for words &amp; phrases used in the Nine Planets Jupiter is the fifth and largest planet in our solar system.  The denser material forms the core and the gas surrounds it.  The other planets&#39; atmospheres consist of different gases. BACKGROUND: An atmosphere is the layer of gases that envelop a planet.  In order to streamline this page for printing, many graphics have been removed. Jun 12, 2010 All of the planets started out with atmospheres of hydrogen and helium.

There are several ways: a large impact can literally blow off the atmosphere (probably happened to Mars).  And don&#39;t do something simply because someone tells you that you should do it.

Actually, I was trying to use this the other way around, I knew the polynomial&#39;s degree was the highest degree of all the monomials in it, but i had no idea how to get the degree of the monomial. ” Examples are 4x2, x2 – 9, or 6x2 + 13x + c.  user-avatar &middot; Math &middot; Algebra.  The degree of a monomial is the sum of the exponents of all its variables.  It is just a classification for different polynomials with different numbers of terms.  Comment. This lesson will show you the steps on how to calculate the degree of a monomial. A monomial is just a special case of a polynomial, so the definition of degree would be the same.  In this polynomial, 24xyz, the degree is 3 because the sum of degrees of x, y and z is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.  A second degree polynomial is also called a “ quadratic.

This post has been edited by As Barry suggested, the &quot;how&quot; depends on the &quot;why&quot; and the &quot;what&quot; of your intentions.  if yes, add it to the new int array.  If you have an array of a&nbsp;Arrays in C.  else, continue to the next value.  C = &#39;Hello, world&#39;.  it should be arranged that way: iterate the char array for every char, check id it is a digit. 2 Character Strings as Arrays Next Page: 7.  int a = 10; char abc[2]; abc[0] = (a / 10) + 0x30; abc[1] = (a % 10) + 0x30; printf(&quot;%c%c&#92;n&quot;, abc[0], abc[1]); Of course Aug 17, 1994 Previous Page: 7. source = something; converter.  ▫ Type: double. h&gt; int main(void) { int i_array[5] = { 65, 66, 67, 68, 69 }; char* c_array[5]; int i = 0; for (i; i &lt; 5; i++) { //c[i] = itoa(array[i]); /* Windows */ /* Linux */ // allocate a big enough char to store an int (which is 4bytes, depending on your platform) char c[sizeof(int)]; // copy int to char snprintf(c, sizeof(int), Nov 8, 2010 Hi all, I would like to ask about how could i convert efficiently an array of int to an array of char. #include &lt;stdio.  • char name[20];.  int a[3] = {0}; // valid C and C++ way to zero-out a block-scope array int a[3] = {}; // invalid C but valid C++ way to zero-out a block-scope array.  • C Array – A Examples.

Hello, I&#39;m trying to convert an integer array into an unsigned char array, but my experience with this is limited.  I don&#39;t want to lose any information during t.  Example: int intArray[3] = {0x12e45c78, 0xa453f. length() + 1; now, i think that the way you wrote the function is not right.  Hi I try to convert a int array into a char array.  when i do it this way, h3 contains &#39;d&#39;.  • Array - a collective name given to a group of similar quantities.  ▫ All integers, floats, chars, etc… ▫ Array of chars is called a “string”.  • double height[10];.

This function can be used to combine a number of variables into one, using the same formatting controls as fprintf(). A character array is a sequence of characters, just as a numeric array is a sequence of numbers.  We will .  and loop to get the digit of number and assign it to array. tgt[0] = something_else; [/code]is a little more self-descr Hello, I&#39;m trying to convert an integer array into an unsigned char array, but my experience with this is limited. now, i think that the way you wrote the function is not right. length() + 1; numCols = s2.  You can use C library `log10` to count the number of digits.  One method to convert an int to a char array is to use sprintf() or snprintf().  My code: void exec() { char mds[32]; int i; int mdc[32] = {50,100,97,51,101,50,99,51,48,55,100,102,55,53,101 ,56,100, 48,101,53,101,52,99,98,102,55,101,50,53,10 0,49,53}; for(i=0; i &lt; 32; i++) { sprintf(mds[i], &quot;%s&quot;, (char*)mdc[i]); } printf(&quot;Result : %s&#92;n&quot;, md5s); } [code]int source; char* tgt; tgt = (char*)&amp;source; [/code]is the nuclear option.

Is there any way to take the characters in the array and make them into their integer equivalent (&#39;3&#39; into the integer 3)? any help is greatly appreciated!

 node.  docker.  I want to trigger a build on 2 different slaves which labeled &quot;tester1&#39; and &quot;tester2&quot;.  If checked, standard output from the task is returned&nbsp;The example shows how to trigger jobs on all Jenkins nodes from Pipeline. Apr 25, 2017 Learn how to use Jenkins to establish a continuous deployment pipeline for Node.  returnStdout (optional).  as a Pipeline script will not work: Jenkins does not know what system to run commands on.  Why? One of the main benefits of parallelism in a pipeline is: to do more material work (see Best Practice #4)! You should generally aim to acquire a node within the parallel branches of your pipeline.  However when I run the TestPipeline job, the &quot;test_job&quot; won&#39;t run on the nodes .  This directive only allows you to specify where the task is to be executed, which agent, slave, label&nbsp;This depends on your actual needs.  * Node list retrieval is being performed using Jenkins API, so it will require script approvals in the Sandbox&nbsp;Execute the Pipeline, or stage, on an agent available in the Jenkins environment with the provided label.  If checked, standard output from the task is returned The example shows how to trigger jobs on all Jenkins nodes from Pipeline.  Many steps (such as: git and sh in this example) can only run in the context of a node, so trying to run just: sh &#39;echo oops&#39;.  Unlike user-defined functions,&nbsp;Jun 27, 2016 The Jenkins Pipeline plugin is a game changer for Jenkins users. Normally, a script which exits with a nonzero status code will cause the step to fail with an exception.  Type: boolean. Apr 23, 2017 I started playing with Jenkins Pipelines using the web interface, then hit a block as I didn&#39;t really know the ropes.  Here&#39;s some things I wish I&#39;d known first: 1) an argument: node(&#39;mynode&#39;) { [] } If the pipeline code is not in a node block, then it&#39;s run on the master in some kind of lightweight node/thread.  Summary: * The script uses NodeLabel Parameter plugin to pass the job name to the payload job. Sep 27, 2017 A question that always crops up when I try to introduce pipelines in my organisation, is how to use the same workspace across different stages that are run in sequence (but where the later stage may be joined by other stages that are being run in parallel).  Unlike user-defined functions,&nbsp;The simple answer is, Agent is for declarative pipelines and node is for scripted pipelines.  For example: pipeline { agent none stages&nbsp;Normally, a script which exits with a nonzero status code will cause the step to fail with an exception.  agent { node { label &#39;labelName&#39; } } behaves the same as agent { label &#39;labelName&#39; } , but node allows for additional options (such as customWorkspace ).  And the pipeline script is quite simple here: node(&#39;tester1&#39;) { build &#39;test_job&#39; } node(&#39;tester2&#39;) { build &#39;test_job&#39; }. Sep 16, 2015 run concurrently, other times it is running parts of your pipeline in parallel with the aim of getting feedback sooner and making the most of your resources.  You may then compare it to zero, for example. js applications, even those that use databases like Couchbase.  Based on a Domain parallel steps.  As soon as you use the parallel step, then you don&#39;t really have a choice besides having stage around node&nbsp;Jun 27, 2016 The Jenkins Pipeline plugin is a game changer for Jenkins users.  agent { node { label &#39;labelName&#39; } } behaves the same as agent { label &#39; labelName&#39; } , but node allows for additional options (such as customWorkspace ) .

If this option is checked, the return value of the step will instead be the status code.  This directive only allows you to specify where the task is to be executed, which agent, slave, label&nbsp;In this case, the code between the braces ( { and } ) is the body of the node step.  I have a Jenkins pipeline job called &quot;TestPipeline&quot;.  As long as you can run your complete pipeline on a single node, I would wrap the stage s in a node so that the pipeline is not blocked by busy executors.  * Node list retrieval is being performed using Jenkins API, so it will require script approvals in the Sandbox Execute the Pipeline, or stage, on an agent available in the Jenkins environment with the provided label.  For example: agent { label &#39;my-defined-label&#39; }.  In declarative pipelines the agent directive is used for specifying which agent/slave the job/task is to be executed on.

Many people might not realize but Jenkins is quite good at parallel workloads, either across nodes in distributed builds, or even inside a running build	</div>

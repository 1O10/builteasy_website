Where and when it occurs.  Evidence for the glyoxylate cycle in human liver.  Human liver can also carry out cyanide-insensitive fatty acid oxida- tion from palmitate.  This is an important capability for microorganisms because they often live in environments where carbohydrates are not available as a food source.  THIS IS A DIRECTORY PAGE.

As described above, the glyoxylate cycle is a specialized pathway that has been extensively studied in connection with bacterial growth on C2 compounds, and ICL and MS. 8 billion years ago, the first life forms were single celled heterotrophs. The enzymatic activities unique to the glyoxylate cycle of higher plants and certain lower invertebrates, isocitrate lyase and malate synthase, have been demonstrated in homogenates prepared from human liver. The glyoxylate cycle can also provide plants with another aspect of metabolic diversity.  Reactions, enzymes, energy cost, coordinated regulation with glycolysis. The urea cycle (also known as the ornithine cycle) is a cycle of biochemical reactions that produces urea ((N H 2) 2 C O) from ammonia (NH 3).

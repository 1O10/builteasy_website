<div class="forumtxt"> A mutex is just a binary semaphore with an initial value of 1, for which each thread calls P-V in strict pairs.  When new event is added, you just wake event thread with pthread_cond_signal() .  #include &lt;pthread. Use a pthread_condition variable with a timeout value equal to your timeout value (granted, you have to take the absolute time and map it to relative time) post to this condition to prematurely wake it up It&#39;ll wake up on it&#39;s own if the timeout expires.  This method is very fast.  to sleep, the thread does this: int nSig; sigwait(&amp;fSigSet, &amp;nSig);.  Oct 19, 2006 Could you by chance set up an alarm, then lock on a semaphore, and wake up the thread waiting on the semaphore when the signal function is called? Here&#39;s some code that might work (I&#39;ve never used pthreads, plus it&#39;s missing certain declarations and initialization):.  Kill sounds bad, but it doesn&#39;t kill the thread, it sends a signal.  May 26, 2014 in startup code somewhere: sigemptyset(&amp;fSigSet); sigaddset(&amp;fSigSet, SIGUSR1); sigaddset(&amp;fSigSet, SIGSEGV);.  to wake up (done from any other thread) pthread_kill(pThread, SIGUSR1);.  (That is, if the pthread-win32 implements the timeout on condition variables&nbsp;Mar 7, 2017 Each of the three major classes of routines in the Pthreads API are then covered: Thread Management, Mutex Variables, and Condition Variables.  Once a thread A completes its P, no other thread can P until A does a matching V.  This means that you have to set up signal handling for the thread in question, and have all the other threads ignore.  If several threads are waiting for the same wake up signal, they will take turns acquiring the mutex, and any one of them can then modify the condition they&nbsp;#include &lt;pthread.  In the obvious case, the thread that misses a wake-up would sleep forever and no work is performed.  The signal and&nbsp;POSIX Pthread libraries on Linux. May 26, 2014 You can sleep a thread using sigwait, and then signal that thread to wake up with pthread_kill.  Code: sem_t s; void catch_alarm(int Nov 6, 2013 Pthread (posix thread) example Sleep and wakeup transitions are initiated by calls to internal sleep/wakeup APIs by a running thread. h&gt; int pthread_cond_broadcast(pthread_cond_t *cond); Service Program When the threads that were the target of the broadcast wake up, they contend for the mutex that they have associated with the condition variable on the call to pthread_cond_timedwait() or pthread_cond_wait().  pthread_kill(pThread, SIGUSR1);Calls like sleep send SIGALRM to the calling process, not just the thread.  The point of the question is that monitors and semaphores are designed to wrap sleep/wakeup in safe higher-level abstractions that allow threads to sleep for events POSIX Pthread libraries on Linux.  YoLinux: Linux Information Portal includes informative tutorials and links to many Linux sites.  SIGALRM (example only, there are other signals) Using a condition wait or a mutex wait is much more efficient.

But often, a thread that missed a wake-up could be recovered by Sep 11, 2014 Lazy code, or code not intended for use on an operating system that suffers from spurious wakeups as defined by Posix (I&#39;m assuming that&#39;s windows but am not sure of the implementation details in pthread-w32) does not need to while(), the code in the manual example does not, but I should probably .

Oct 19, 2006 Could you by chance set up an alarm, then lock on a semaphore, and wake up the thread waiting on the semaphore when the signal function is called? Here&#39;s some code that might work (I&#39;ve never used pthreads, plus it&#39;s missing certain declarations and initialization):. h&gt; int pthread_cond_signal(pthread_cond_t *cond); Service Program Name: Note: For dependable use of condition variables, and to ensure that you do not lose wake-up operations on condition variables, your application should always use a Boolean predicate and a mutex with the condition variable. What you are looking for is pthread_cond_t object, pthread_cond_timedwait and pthread_cond_wait functions.  If the system did not release the lock when the waiting thread entered the wait, no other thread could get the mutex and change&nbsp;#include &lt;pthread. POSIX Pthread libraries on Linux.

Calls like sleep send SIGALRM to the calling process, not just the thread.  or to wake up you could do this: tgkill(nPid, nTid Calls like sleep send SIGALRM to the calling process, not just the thread.

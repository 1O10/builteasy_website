 The relevant code is here and it shows that only the first serial port is handled. The Genuino 101 — also sold in the USA as the Arduino 101 — is positioned as a successor to the venerable UNO, adopting the same much loved and often imitated form factor. Serial is the only serial port connected to USB.  It keeps the same robust form factor and peripheral list of the UNO with the addition of onboard Bluetooth LE capabilities and a 6-axis&nbsp;May 8, 2014 Hi, I just newbies for UDOO.

You should move to available() calls inside the loop to make your sketch compatible with all boards generations. May 24, 2017 I have a sketch of an arduino mega 2560 and Hm10, everything works with software serial on pin 10/11 but if i change the software serial pins, it won´t work, any ideas? i need to change the pins because i am using the s…Hi dataino, the SerialEvent API is obsolete and only makes sense on boards with a single UART (or Processing).  To use the serial monitor, and see what your sketch does from the beginning, you&#39;ll need to add few lines of code inside the setup().  I try to use Serial Monitor on Arduino to monitor Serial1 but it doesn&#39;t print out like Serial0, How can i fixed it? Thanks.

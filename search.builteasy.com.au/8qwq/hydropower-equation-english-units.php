The two vital factors to consider are the flow and the head of the stream or river.  The calculator below can be used to calculate available hydroelectricity power.  Power in kilowatts can be determined by the following equation: kW = H x Q x 62.  Power&nbsp;Hydro Power Calculator These calculations are intended to help in the surveying or assessment of a site to generate hydro electricity.  In North America, and in some other parts of the world, we use English units.  Using the English units for ρ, g, Q, and H, and including a conversion factor for P to MW, yields the simplified equation: P = (η QH) / (1.  density (kg/m3).  = 1 hp. 4 lbs. 81 = 2,943 Watts.

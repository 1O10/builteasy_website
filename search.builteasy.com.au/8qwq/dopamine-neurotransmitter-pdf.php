Dopamine alters the sensitivity of its target neu- rons to other neurotransmitters,&nbsp;It&#39;s essential that we learn about dopamine projections before studying how antipsychotics modify dopaminergic neurotransmission.  However, in the early stages of Parkinson&#39;s disease (PD), alterations of executive functions also suggest a role for DA in regulating cognitive functions.  * Several classes of drugs, notably the antipsychotics,&nbsp;Nov 22, 2011 In the early 1970s, receptors for neurotransmitters acting via second messengers had not been identified biochemically nor were there definitive links to such messengers.

INTRODUCTION.  Dopamine is a neuromodulator that is used by neurons in several brain regions involved in motivation and re- inforcement, most importantly the nucleus accumbens.

In the brain, dopamine functions as a neurotransmitter—a chemical released by neurons (nerve cells) to send signals to other nerve cells.  By Dr Ananya Mandal, MD.  Within the central nervous system (CNS), dopamine is known to regulate emotion, reward, cognition, memory, endocrine functions, and motor control.

Genetic Implication.  * The three major distinct dopaminergic systems in the mammalian brain (nigro- striatal, meso-limbic, meso-cortical, tubero-infundibular). Dopamine (DA) is a neurotransmitter in the central and peripheral nervous systems where it regulates numerous physiological processes.  Dopamine (3-hydroxytyramine; DA) is a catecholamine neurotransmitter that is a precursor to the synthesis of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE).

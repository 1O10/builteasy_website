View Gas Fuel Properties; View NOx Measurement Property: Units: Diesel Oil (Gas Oil) Light Fuel Oil (LFO) Most MAN medium speed liquid fuel engines can burn heavy fuel oil (HFO). The generic term heavy fuel oil (HFO) describes fuels used to generate motion and/or fuels to generate heat that have a particularly high viscosity and density.  Heavy: 1% sulphur and below Marine Bunker Fuel will have a density of around 0.  However, no practical theory exists for the calculation of these properties for heavy oil at .  95 at room temperature (68 degrees F), and that translates to a weight density of about 59.  Heavy fuel oils have large percentages of heavy molecules such as long-chain hydrocarbons and aromatics with long-branched side chains.  85 FUEL OIL, [NO.  Combustion : Air&nbsp;HFO, also known as “residual fuel oil”, is based on the high viscosity, tar-like mass, which remains after the distillation and subsequent cracking of crude oil in order to produce lighter hydrocarbon products, such as petrol , distillate diesel fuels and heating oil or feedstocks for lubricants.  Asphalt.  Density is an in API gravity between light and heavy oil changes Extra heavy oil is defined with API gravity below 10.  6 oil, Texas (60 F), Diesel Fuel Oil (20 to 60 Heavy Oil and Fuel Oil Applications(Baffled), Circulation Heater.  and Alikhan, A.  ) worldwide.

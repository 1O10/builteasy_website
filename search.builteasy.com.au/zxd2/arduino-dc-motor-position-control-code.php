I was trying to do a position control of my DC motor without using encoder which is already attached to the motor, but controlling it via Arduino code as it appears in the attached code.  For all the people that don&#39;t use the Python environment I decided to make an executable for GUI tested on windows10 and 7.  There is a link where you can Aug 16, 2010 Using a printer I got at a garage sale this weekend, I made another servo out of a DC motor. ) I am *NOT* going to explain what PID is, or how PID works.  Moving forwards, this hardware and code can be adapted to make a small driving robot.  The switch is really quite simple, and because of the way we wired it, it will read HIGH when it is in the forward position.  however, I couldn&#39;t May 12, 2014 I&#39;ve updated the test code I&#39;m using to manage my X and Y axis DC motor / linear encoder closed loop controller.  This project uses and Arduino (or similar) to create a closed-loop position control for a DC motor to act as a replacement of a stepper motor and its drive electronics.

A rotary encoder is a device that converts the angular position or motion of a shaft or an axle to an analog or digital code.  Instead off simple present value minus the set point for error.

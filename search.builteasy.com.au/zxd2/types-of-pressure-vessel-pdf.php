The strength/failure theory utilized. CODE AND NON-CODE VESSEL STYLES AND INFORMATION .  Each type has assets and liabilities.  Pressure vessels have been classified in four categories, based on their construction. A pressure vessel is a container designed to hold gases or liquids at a pressure substantially different from the ambient pressure.  A Vertical Cut Plane.

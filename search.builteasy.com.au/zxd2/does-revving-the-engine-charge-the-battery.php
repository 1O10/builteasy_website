 I would like to charge the [Archive] Battery charge faster if revving engine? General Questions Jul 18, 2017 · The initial charge of your battery and the kind drive cycle you how does a in car itself? Does revving engine url? Q answers.  Once the car starts, you CAN rev it up to charge the battery faster, but the best way to do that is to just&nbsp;The qualified answer is: no.  With these, the dynamo&#39;s voltage would increase at higher rpm.  You want to turn all of the accessories off.  Some engines wont charge the battery during rapid acceleration (e.  The battery now has a weak charge but it can get the engine started (barely).  The best thing to do is just run the car for awhile or put a battery charger on it. gLuke, It should make little difference in todays modern cars with regulators that keep electrical output at constant levels of voltage in order to charge your battery with regulated current.  It started right up. Do you want it charged 100% or enough to start it the next time.  The typical Alternator setup will only provide a portion of it&#39;s maximum output (amperage) at idle.  Apr 09, 2009 · Now as to the question of revving the engine.  I have seen people revving their engine when jumping cars.  Most cars while running charge around 14 volts and only go up around . Older cars used a dynamo with permanent magnets. 2 to .  Even if the battery was very drained, and you have all of the electrical devices the car is equipped with turned on.  If the drain is too high, the voltage decreases dramatically.  Having the alternator deliver power will help hold up the &quot;good&quot; battery voltage, and compensate for the assumed lower voltage of the jumped vehicle. When jump starting a car, will revving the engine of the good car speed up the process, or does it make no diffference? If you have to you can even jump another car with the jumping &#39;good&#39; car not running at all. Namely the size of the battery and its general health.  The alternator is run by a belt,&nbsp;If the engine still won&#39;t start, allow the good car to run for 5-10 minutes while hooked up to the dead car.  Whenever the battery is called upon to deliver current, its terminal voltage decreases, even when another car is not being jumped.  The real answer has a lot of nuance, the amount of energy available to charge the battery changes with engine speed but the relationship isn&#39;t linear.  Both batteries have a source of charge and after a few brief moments, enough stored potential energy to start the car with the dead battery.  You never want to &quot;floor&quot; the gas pedal, under any circumstances.  But when your engine turns faster, the engine&#39;s alternator also turns faster.  If these steps do not work after three or four more tries, My car had been sitting for a while without being driven.  Also, keep in mind that the dead battery requires much more voltage to be of any use.  If you&#39;ver recently got your car jump-started because ofa dead battery, will revving your engine charge the battery more quickly Often, batteries charge much faster than the charging rate at idle.  That way, all of the alternator&#39;s power can be directed to recharging the battery.  Whenever the battery is called upon to deliver current, its terminal Dec 8, 2002 If you&#39;ver recently got your car jump-started because ofa dead battery, will revving your engine charge the battery more quickly then keeping it at idle? If the alternator does not provide all the required electricity, the battery will also provide some to make up the difference.  The battery may be shorted internally, or the&nbsp;Enough to be safely regulated to 13. The charging capacity of the alternator and the quality of the connections.  Rev the engine slightly.  This may build a charge in the dead battery and allow you to restart.  Does revving the engine charge the battery.  and to what extent you want it charged. 5 and enough to charge both batteries.  Some engines wont charge the battery during rapid acceleration (BMWs with ActiveDynamics (as I think it&#39;s called)) won&#39;t charge the battery during acceleration, rather, the engine stops turning the alternator and uses the power for propulsion. 5 volts, which doesn&#39;t do much of anything.  You should have your battery and charging system tested&nbsp;I&#39;ve heard different answers on this.  Does that actually do anything?There are a few variable involved.  TOM: Revving up the engine during a jump-start is not a bad idea, within reason. The engine RPM won&#39;t really matter as&nbsp;If the engine still won&#39;t start, allow the good car to run for 5-10 minutes while hooked up to the dead car.  You should have your battery and charging system tested&nbsp;May 17, 2017 Of course, a battery can maintain a charge while the engine is on, but once it&#39;s off electronics draw directly from the battery.  And when an alternator turns faster, it produces more electricity.  To avoid this recurring auto nightmare, Also, batteries—alive or dead—are full of chemicals, so do nature a favor and dispose of dead ones properly. The engine RPM won&#39;t really matter as&nbsp;No.  Don&#39;t just toss it in the trash&nbsp;Apr 1, 2007 RAY: So by revving your engine up to 2,000 rpm or 2,500 rpm and holding it there while the other car tries to start, you&#39;re increasing the output of your alternator and giving your battery a little bit of extra power, which it can donate to the other car.  If these steps do not work after three or four more tries, stop trying to jump-start. There are a few variable involved.  The alternator is run by a belt,&nbsp;Was just out to eat and the couple behind me was on the phone calling someone to come give them a jump, dead battery.  Often, running at idle wouldn&#39;t provide a high enough voltage to keep the battery charged.  (maybe 60amps) But during start, your vehicle requires a massive amount of electrical current (hundreds of am - Car and&nbsp;Dec 8, 2002 If you&#39;ver recently got your car jump-started because ofa dead battery, will revving your engine charge the battery more quickly then keeping it at idle? If the alternator does not provide all the required electricity, the battery will also provide some to make up the difference.  I was right there so I just did it myself.  This battery recharges itself how fast does the alternator charge the battery? What&#39;s better -- revving the engine for a while, or simply turning off all accessories, and not revving? . My question is – will starting a low-use car up and letting it idle for a period of time (say 15 mins, maybe 30 mins) actually charge the battery and do it any good? Or will it be better to drive it around the block? I don&#39;t have a plug in battery charger to trickle-charge it – perhaps if the above isn&#39;t an efficient way&nbsp;No. Apr 1, 2007 RAY: For the donee -- the car that&#39;s receiving the jump-start -- the same rules apply.  Any car with an alternator will maintain the set voltage at just about any engine speed	</div>

<p>2 × 1012 eV.  Gamma&nbsp;The rainbow of colors we know as visible light is the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum with wavelengths between 400 and 700 billionths of a meter (400 to 700 nanometers). 01 nanometers (about the size of an atomic nucleus).  Hard gamma, 1 × 10-9 nm, 3 × 1026 Hz, 1.  Expressed in more familiar units, the .  It is the part of the electromagnetic spectrum that we see, and coincides with the wavelength of greatest intensity of sunlight.  Its broad The types of electromagnetic radiation are listed above in decreasing order of wavelength, and hence increasing order of frequency.  This visible light region consists of a spectrum of wavelengths that range from approximately 700 nanometers (abbreviated nm) to approximately 400 nm.  Because the energy of electromagnetic radiation (i.  The term &quot;infrared&quot; refers to a broad range of frequencies, beginning at the top end of those frequencies used for communication and extending up the the low frequency (red) end of the visible spectrum. e. The term &quot;infrared&quot; refers to a broad range of frequencies, beginning at the top end of those frequencies used for communication and extending up the the low frequency (red) end of the visible spectrum.  You know more about the Using nanometers, violet, blue, green, yellow, orange, and red light have wavelengths between 400 and 700 nanometers.  Electromagnetic radiation is caused by the disturbance Wavelengths of the visible region of the spectrum range from 700 nm for red light to 400 nm for violet light.  Wavelengths increase from approximately 10 -18 m to 100 km, and this corresponds to frequencies decreasing from 3 × 1026 Hz to 3 ×103 Hz.  A rainbow shows the optical (visible) part of the electromagnetic spectrum; infrared (if it could be seen) would be located just beyond the red side of the rainbow with ultraviolet appearing just beyond the violet end.

If radiation having a frequency in the visible region of the EM spectrum reflects off of In this sense, we are referring to visible light, a small spectrum from the enormous range of frequencies of electromagnetic radiation.  Visible waves have The other types of EM radiation that make up the electromagnetic spectrum are microwaves, infrared light, ultraviolet light, X-rays and gamma-rays.

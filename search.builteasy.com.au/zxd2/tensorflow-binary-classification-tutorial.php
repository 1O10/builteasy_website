<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>estimator API in TensorFlow to solve a binary classification problem: Given census data about a person such as age, education, marital status, and occupation (the features), we will try to predict whether or not the person earns more than 50,000 dollars a year (the target label).  I am wondering if there is any easy example to start with.  So maybe employ a chi-squared test of two proportions ( p 1 for the proportion of ones in the output and p 2 for the proportion of ones in each feature). 0) is 0. com/JRMeyer/tensorflow-tutorial.

It doesn&#39;t take any effort for humans to tell apart a lion and a jaguar, read a sign, or recognize a human&#39;s face.  Our brains make vision seem easy.  After training is done, these parameters and architecture will be saved in a binary file(called model).  var1 var2 var3 label. git cd tensorflow-tutorial&nbsp;Logistic Regression using TensorFlow.

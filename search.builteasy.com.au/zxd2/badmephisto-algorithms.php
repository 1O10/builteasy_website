 It can be done in 6 moves or less ~82% of the time and â‰¤7 moves 99.  badmephisto&#39;s Speedcubing Guide; Christopher Olson&#39;s CLL Guide; Phillip Espinoza&#39;s COL Guide; Weston&#39;s OH Last Layer; Odder&#39;s Megaminx Last Layer.  Each guide is designed to contain every algorithm you need to solve the cube, but assumes that you know the basics of how to link them all together.

In 2 look OLL, I&#39;ve decreased the from 54 algorithms into only 9 algorithms to make it much more easier than the normal OLL.  PLL is the last step of the Fridrich Method. html2 Look OLL(Orientation of the Last Layer). Jul 25, 2009Rubik&#39;s Cube tutorials: From beginners to advanced, and a little bit of stuff I program in my spare time, mostly in Python.  OLL is the 3rd step of the Fridrich Method.  Easy Cases (1-4).  Kingma, and Yaroslav Bulatov Here&#39;s the gear I&#39;m using: http://bit.  Right after you finish the F2L, your cube will look like one of the following cases on top.  It is relatively easy to understand . 95% of the time.  U (R U&#39; R&#39;).  These are just optimal example solves; F2L should be solved intuitively. RUR&#39;U&#39; takes out a pair.  After performing the algorithm, your cube should be all yellow on top.  Use (R&#39; F R F&#39;) if no U face edges are oriented properly on final slot y&#39; U&#39; (R&#39; U R).  3x3x3 Guides Made With the Pros.  Before you go off finding which case you have, use U/U&#39;/U2&nbsp;How to become a Speedcuber.  This is a beginners&#39; guide to solving the Rubik&#39;s cube layer-by-layer. could someone do me a favor and put badmephisto&#39;s pll algorithms and guide on a microsoft word page or something so I can print it out (prefferably onFeatures. Orientation of Last Layer (OLL). com/2-look-oll. Rubik&#39;s Cube tutorials: From beginners to advanced, and a little bit of stuff I program in my spare time, mostly in Python.  Q: Cool, then what? A: Download my iPhone/Android app called &quot;badmephisto&quot;, which gives a nice on-the-go cheat sheet for the algorithms you will need to remember.  Find out which diagram indicates how you need to move them around, and apply the algorithm.  The main aim of 2 look OLL is to turn a non oriented face of the 3rd layer into a an oriented face. For example, any of these cubes will be much better than anything you can buy in store and only cost about $12. ly/RedKB-Gear What&#39;s up YouTube, my name&#39;s Kenneth and I like twisty puzzles! I make a video at least every month out o Everyone knows that solving a Rubik&#39;s Cube can be a long, frustrating, hair-pulling feat.  After watching the video above, I reommend you watch my video called How to Become a Speedcuber, which tells you in what order you should be learning the more advanced algorithms. weebly.  I find it easy to learn this algorithm by tracking F2L pairs around the cube.  For people who love any sort of geometric puzzles, including but not limited to: Rubik&#39;s Cubes (and any size/design variants), the Square 1, the Pyraminx, et al.  And if you find this stuff useful, you can&nbsp;You must solve the cross first.  R&#39;F hides it and takes the other pair out to the top layer. Permutation of Last Layer (PLL&#39;s).  Big Cubes.  After you finish OLL, pieces on the last layer will need to be permuted (moved around). Jul 25, 2009 Ever wondered how you can solve the Rubik&#39;s Cube? From my 2 years of cubing experience, I firmly believe this to be the easiest and best beginner&#39;s method fo Rubik&#39;s Cube Solution - 2 Look OLL cubefreak.  R2U&#39;R&#39; aligns this pair with the whites and hides that pair.  see under:-.  OLL is the last step in Fridrich method. The algorithm has a little bit of a symmetry to it.  Contains optimal algorithms for the full F2L, the 2 look OLL and all of the PLL algorithms Our family got our first Rubik&#39;s Cube and we have found it a great way to teach coding, algorithms, and robots to our kids.  Orientation of Last Layer (OLL) First of the two last-layer steps, OLL corrects the orientarion of all last layer pieces in one step so that all U-stickers have the U Tim Salimans, Andrej Karpathy, Xi Chen, Diederik P.

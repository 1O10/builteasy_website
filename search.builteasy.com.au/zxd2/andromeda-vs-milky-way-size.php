Dec 29, 2008 The Andromeda galaxy (also known as Messier 31, M31, or NGC 224) could be considered the big brother of the Milky Way, as it contains over a trillion stars (compared to our 200-400 billion), and is approximately 220,000 light years across to our 100,000.  &quot;Historically, estimations of the Milky Way&#39;s mass have been all over the map,&quot;&nbsp;Aug 25, 2013Milky Way vs.  Its name stems from the area of the sky in which it appears, the constellation of Andromeda. ) It&#39;s 2.  10.

Oct 14, 2004 Right now, the Milky Way and Andromeda are so far apart that even light takes two million years to journey between them.  Imagine the Milky Way galaxy as a music CD (the thickness compared to its diameter is about right). 5 * 10^11 Solar Masses.  Milky Way vs.  Also shown is a smaller galaxy, Triangulum, which may be part of the . 5 trillion kilometers.  The 2006 observations by the&nbsp;The Andromeda–Milky Way collision is a galactic collision predicted to occur in about 4 billion years between the two largest galaxies in the Local Group—the Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy.  The stars involved are sufficiently far apart that it is improbable that any of them will individually collide.  Some stars will be&nbsp;Aug 3, 2014 A recent study conducted by an international team of researchers, which has been published in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, suggests that Andromeda is in fact two times the size of Milky Way.

You can see it on a dark night in the constellation Andromeda, from the central The Andromeda–Milky Way collision is a galactic collision predicted to occur in about 4 billion years between the two largest galaxies in the Local Group—the The Milky Way and Andromeda are moving toward each other under the inexorable pull of gravity. 14.  But on the scale of galaxies, they are quite close together. 5 million light-years from us, while the Moon is only 384,400 kilometers away.  Which is bigger: Andromeda Galaxy or the Size of the Milky way. 5 million light-years from us, while The galaxy, which is about the same size as the Milky Way, Dr Penarrubia said: &#39;We always suspected that Andromeda is more massive than the Milky Way, Oct 29, 2006 · The Andromeda is a spiral galaxy about twice the size of the Milky Way. Jan 2, 2014 Andromeda—or M31—is larger than our Milky Way (although not as massive, if you count the dark matter in our galaxy.  Even with this graphic comparison, the size of&nbsp;Let us look at the data about the sizes of the both Galaxies.  Andromeda: Andromeda is still believed to be bigger and have many more stars than the Milky Way--possibly Apollo 17 Astronaut Laments Size of Andromeda is twice as massive as the Milky Way.  Milky way Galaxy Our Milky way Galaxy is 160000 light years in Diameters with the stars up to 400 billion based on the observation. The Andromeda–Milky Way collision is a galactic collision predicted to occur in about 4 billion years between the two largest galaxies in the Local Group—the Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy.  The Andromeda galaxy is the closest spiral galaxy to the Milky Way (though it&#39;s not the closest galaxy).  It&#39;s the most distant object you can easily see with the naked eye (under good observing conditions).  Andromeda But the interesting fact is Both Andromeda and Milky way are going to collide Student Features.  Scientists say that Andromeda has twice the mass, made of dark matter, than the Milky Way.  the Milky Way and Andromeda are so far apart that even light takes two million years Andromeda is a spiral galaxy of similar size, Milky Way vs.  The 2006 observations by the&nbsp;Feb 21, 2006 Astronomers have figured out the density of dark matter and how fast it&#39;s moving in our corner of the universe<strong></strong></p>

 For example, if you divide one hour by three then you get . Feb 26, 2014 Learn about the sexagesimal system of measurement from this video.  Base 60 allows&nbsp;The following three different systems of units are used in the measurement of trigonometrical angles: Sexagesimal System(or English System), Centesimal System(or French System), Circular System.  The number 258,458 expressed in the sexagesimal (base 60) system of the Babylonians and in cuneiform.  It originated with the ancient Sumerians in the 3rd millennium BC, was passed down to the ancient Babylonians, and is still used—in a modified form—for measuring time, angles, and geographic coordinates.  It is not however very convenient on account of the multipliers 60 and 90.  That&#39;s because there are no approximations in Babylonian trig. Alternative Title: base-60 number system.  – Find&nbsp;In the Sexagesimal system of measurement a right angle is divided into 90 This system is well established and is always used in the practical applications of Trigonometry.  He and Mansfield say that the base 60, or sexagesimal, number system is far more accurate than the decimal system we&#39;re used to. S.  Whether this is only&nbsp;Trigonometry: The word trigonometry is taken from Greek words &#39;trigon&#39; and &#39;metron&#39; and the meaning for the words is &#39;measuring the sides of a triangle&#39;.

The number 60, a superior highly composite Feb 26, 2014 Learn about the sexagesimal system of measurement from this video.  The OB scribes used a richer sexagesimal (base 60) system which is more suitable for exact computation than our decimal system, and while they were not shy of approximation they had a preference for exact calculation.  The sexagesimal system is better suited for exact calculation.  The paper gives examples showing how the table is more precise than other known tables ( though not as precise as what we get using computers).  The paper gives examples showing how the table is more precise than other known tables (though not as precise as what we get using computers).  Notably the Babylonians did not use angles to describe a right triangle. youtube.  math history - Why is base 60 more precise for trigonometry, can math.

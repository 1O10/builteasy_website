They are used for billing power drawn by industrial customers.  The meter has advanced data and tamper recording capabilities and is provided with communication ports.  The meter is plugged into an outlet, and the appliance to be measured is plugged&nbsp;b) Snapshot values of phase Voltage, Current &amp; Power Factor, Active Energy value during occurrence &amp; restoration to be provided in the above mentioned first three tamper conditions.  The Trivector enables the simultaneous measurement of different electrical parameters&nbsp;The 3 Phase CT Operated Trivector Meter is designed for metering of HT/LT consumers and for feeders.

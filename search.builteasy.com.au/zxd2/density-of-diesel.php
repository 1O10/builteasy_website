It is produced from the fractional distillation of crude oil The density of petroleum diesel is about 0.  Mike W.  Viscosity Diesel is a petroleum-based fuel with the highest energy density among transportation fuels - that&#39;s more energy per gallon than other alternatives.  The purity was ensured by testing density and kinematic viscosity and comparing the values obtained with respective prescribed values.  Diesel fuel has a varying density depending on the type of diesel; for instance, diesel 1D fuel has a density of 54.  79 metric tons per cubic meter.  Petroleum diesel or petrodiesel is produced by THERMODYNAMICS.  It is especially suitable for diesel engines designed to meet the latest European and American emission standards and Another experimental method is to combine electrical mobility sizing with aerodynamic sizing.

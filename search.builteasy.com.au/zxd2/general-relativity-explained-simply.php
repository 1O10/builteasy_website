And of a simple equation which I cannot resist giving here, Layman&#39;s explanation and understanding of Einstein&#39;s field equations.  It introduced a new framework for all of physics and proposed new concepts of space and time.  The nucleus of any atom is an oven of intense radiation, and when you open the oven door, that energy spills out; oftentimes violently.

However, Nov 7, 2017 In 1905, Albert Einstein determined that the laws of physics are the same for all non-accelerating observers, and that the speed of light in a vacuum was independent of the motion of all observers.

One of the clearest, most entertaining introductions to the subject ever written offers lucid explanations of not only the special and general theories of relativity .  Carlo Rovelli&#39;s &#39;Seven Brief Lessons in Physics&#39; outsold &#39;50 Shades of Grey &#39; on publication in Italy last year.  General relativity was Einstein&#39;s theory of gravity, published in 1915, which extended special relativity to take into account non-inertial frames of reference — areas that are accelerating with respect to each other.  General relativity takes the form of field equations, describing&nbsp;Oct 11, 2011 This principle led Einstein to consider incorporating gravity into the framework of his special theory of relativity, culminating in his General Theory of .  Einstein then spent 10 years trying to include acceleration in the theory and published his theory of general relativity in 1915.

General Theory of Relativity explained: This is the idea of the theory of general relativity.  The basic idea is so elegant that you don’t need superpowers to understand it. By Andrew Zimmerman Jones, Daniel Robbins. Oct 29, 2015 One hundred years ago, Albert Einstein completed his general theory of relativity, which explains how the gravitational force works.  The central idea of general relativity is that space and time are two aspects of spacetime.  However, Einstein&#39;s theory of general relativity predicted that the space-time around Earth would be not only warped but also twisted by the planet&#39;s rotation.

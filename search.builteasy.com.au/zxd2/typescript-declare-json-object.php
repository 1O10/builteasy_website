Finally, the encode and decode functions can just be methods on the User class.  You don&#39;t need to declare the type of the object. MakeTypes generates TypeScript classes that parse and typecheck JSON objects at runtime, and let you statically type check code that interacts with JSON objects.  TypeScript supports getters/setters as a way of intercepting accesses to a member of an object.  On my quest to load and save objects as JSON, I found that you can convert a JSON object to an interface via something called type assertion.  Introduction.
